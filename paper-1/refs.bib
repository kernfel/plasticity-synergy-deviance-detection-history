  abstract = "``Brian'' is a popular Python-based simulator for spiking neural
              networks, commonly used in computational neuroscience. GeNN is a
              C++-based meta-compiler for accelerating spiking neural network
              simulations using consumer or high performance grade graphics
              processing units (GPUs). Here we introduce a new software
              package, Brian2GeNN, that connects the two systems so that users
              can make use of GeNN GPU acceleration when developing their
              models in Brian, without requiring any technical knowledge about
              GPUs, C++ or GeNN. The new Brian2GeNN software uses a pipeline of
              code generation to translate Brian scripts into C++ code that can
              be used as input to GeNN, and subsequently can be run on suitable
              NVIDIA GPU accelerators. From the user's perspective, the entire
              pipeline is invoked by adding two simple lines to their Brian
              scripts. We have shown that using Brian2GeNN, two non-trivial
              models from the literature can run tens to hundreds of times
              faster than on CPU.",

  title    = "Brian 2, an intuitive and efficient neural simulator",
  author   = "Stimberg, Marcel and Brette, Romain and Goodman, Dan F M",
  abstract = "Brian 2 allows scientists to simply and efficiently simulate
              spiking neural network models. These models can feature novel
              dynamical equations, their interactions with the environment, and
              experimental protocols. To preserve high performance when
              defining new models, most simulators offer two options: low-level
              programming or description languages. The first option requires
              expertise, is prone to errors, and is problematic for
              reproducibility. The second option cannot describe all aspects of
              a computational experiment, such as the potentially complex logic
              of a stimulation protocol. Brian addresses these issues using
              runtime code generation. Scientists write code with simple and
              concise high-level descriptions, and Brian transforms them into
              efficient low-level code that can run interleaved with their
              code. We illustrate this with several challenging examples: a
              plastic model of the pyloric network, a closed-loop sensorimotor
              model, a programmatic exploration of a neuron model, and an
              auditory model with real-time input.",

  abstract = "Evoked activities in the neural systems often depend on the event
              probabilities, suggesting that the neural systems have prediction
              capability based on the memory of stimulus history. Such
              prediction capability is often characterized as deviance
              detection property, which is not explained by the mere eï¬€ect of
              stimulus specific adaptation. We here investigate whether
              neuronal dissociate culture, i.e., one of the most primitive
              neural circuits, exhibits deviance detection property as found in
              the higher-order sensory and association cortices. A high-dense
              CMOS electrode array measured neural activity patterns evoked by
              patterned electrical stimuli under either an oddball condition or
              many standards control (MSC) condition. Our results demonstrated
              the deviant-evoked neural activities were larger than the
              standard-evoked neural activities in the oddball condition and
              that the deviant stimulus evoked significantly larger activities
              in the oddball condition than in the MSC condition. Furthermore,
              these trends were more obvious in the late responses, which were
              mediated by a number of synapses, than in the early responses
              that were directly elicited by microstimulation. Thus, the
              present study showed the first evidence that the neuronal
              dissociate culture exhibits the deviance detection property, or
              the primitive intelligence.",

  title     = "The neural code between neocortical pyramidal neurons depends on

  abstract  = "\textbackslashtextlessp\textbackslashtextgreaterAlthough
               signaling between neurons is central to the functioning of the
               brain, we still do not understand how the code used in signaling
               depends on the properties of synaptic transmission. Theoretical
               analysis combined with patch clamp recordings from pairs of
               neocortical pyramidal neurons revealed that the rate of synaptic
               depression, which depends on the probability of neurotransmitter
               release, dictates the extent to which firing rate and temporal
               coherence of action potentials within a presynaptic population
               are signaled to the postsynaptic neuron. The postsynaptic
               response primarily reflects rates of firing when depression is
               slow and temporal coherence when depression is fast. A wide
               range of rates of synaptic depression between different pairs of
               pyramidal neurons was found, suggesting that the relative
               contribution of rate and temporal signals varies along a
               continuum. We conclude that by setting the rate of synaptic
               depression, release probability is an important factor in
               determining the neural
               code.\textbackslashtextless/p\textbackslashtextgreater",
