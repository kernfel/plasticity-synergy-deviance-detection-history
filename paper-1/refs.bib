              action potentials between many cell types. To capture the essence
              of these interactions, it is of critical importance to build
              mathematical models that reflect the characteristic features of
              spike generation in individual neurons. We propose a framework to
              automatically extract such features from current-clamp
              experiments, in particular the passive properties of a neuron
              (i.e., membrane time constant, reversal potential, and
              capacitance), the spike-triggered adaptation currents, as well as
              the dynamics of the action potential threshold. The stochastic
              model that results from our maximum likelihood approach
              accurately predicts the spike times, the subthreshold voltage,
              the firing patterns, and the type of frequency-current curve.
              Extracting the model parameters for three cortical cell types
              revealed that cell types show highly significant differences in
              the time course of the spike-triggered currents and moving
              threshold, that is, in their adaptation and refractory properties
              but not in their passive properties. In particular, GABAergic
              fast-spiking neurons mediate weak adaptation through
              spike-triggered currents only, whereas regular spiking excitatory
              neurons mediate adaptation with both moving threshold and
              spike-triggered currents. GABAergic nonfast-spiking neurons
              combine the two distinct adaptation mechanisms with reduced
              strength. Differences between cell types are large enough to
              enable automatic classification of neurons into three different
              classes. Parameter extraction is performed for individual neurons
              so that we find not only the mean parameter values for each
              neuron type but also the spread of parameters within a group of
              neurons, which will be useful for future large-scale computer

              decay time course of the synaptic conductance independent of
              dendritic geometry and the electrotonic location of the synapse.
              The method is based on the experimental procedure of Pearce
              (1993), consisting of a series of identical somatic voltage jumps
              repeated at various times relative to the onset of the synaptic
              conductance. The progression of synaptic charge recovered by
              successive jumps has a characteristic shape, which can be
              described by an analytical function consisting of sums of
              exponentials. The voltage jump method was tested with simulations
              using simple equivalent cylinder cable models as well as detailed
              compartmental models of pyramidal cells. The decay time course of
              the synaptic conductance could be estimated with high accuracy,
              even with high series resistances, low membrane resistances, and
              electrotonically remote, distributed synapses. The method also
              provides the time course of the voltage change at the synapse in
              response to a somatic voltage-clamp step and thus may be useful
              for constraining compartmental models and estimating the relative
              electrotonic distance of synapses. In conjunction with an
              estimate of the attenuation of synaptic charge, the method also
              permits recovery of the amplitude of the synaptic conductance. We
              use the method experimentally to determine the decay time course
              of excitatory synaptic conductances in neocortical pyramidal
              cells. The relatively rapid decay time constant we have estimated

              replicable rat model of MMN, as a platform for a more thorough

              therefore tested several methods that have been used to control
              for adaptation and differential exogenous responses to stimuli
              within the oddball paradigm. Epidural electroencephalographic
              electrodes were surgically implanted over different cortical

              control was used to control for differential responses to the
              physical characteristics of standards and deviants; the many
              standards control was used to control for differential
              adaptation, as was the cascade control. Both adaptation and
              adaptation-independent deviance detection were observed for high
              frequency (pitch), but not low frequency deviants. In addition,
              the many standards control method was found to be the optimal
              method for observing both adaptation effects and
              adaptation-independent mismatch responses in rats. Inconclusive
              results arose from the cascade control design as it is not yet

              evidence supporting the hypothesis that rat brain is indeed
              capable of exhibiting human-like MMN, and that the rat model is a

               depends on the properties of synaptic transmission. Theoretical
               analysis combined with patch clamp recordings from pairs of
               neocortical pyramidal neurons revealed that the rate of synaptic
               depression, which depends on the probability of neurotransmitter

               coherence of action potentials within a presynaptic population
               are signaled to the postsynaptic neuron. The postsynaptic
               response primarily reflects rates of firing when depression is
