\section{Introduction}\label{sec-intro}


\section{Methods}\label{sec-methods}

\subsection{Model}\label{sec-model}

We modeled neurons as leaky integrate-and-fire units whose membrane potential $V_m$ at time $t$ followed
\begin{equation}
    \tau_m \frac{dV_m}{dt} = (V_{rest}-V_m) + I_{syn}(t)
\end{equation}
with $tau_m = 30$~ms the membrane time constant and $V_{rest} = -60$~mV the resting membrane potential. Synaptic currents were modeled in a conductance-based manner, following
\begin{equation}
    I_{syn} = g_e(E_e-V_m) + g_i(E_i-V_m)
\end{equation}
with $E_e = 0$~mV and $E_i = -100$~mV the excitatory and inhibitory reversal potentials, respectively. Synaptic conductances evolved according to
\begin{align} 
    \tau_e \frac{dg_e}{dt} &= -g_e + \sum_{j \in \boldsymbol E} U x_j w \delta(t - \hat{t_j}) \nonumber \\
    \tau_i \frac{dg_i}{dt} &= -g_i + \sum_{j \in \boldsymbol I} w \delta(t - \hat{t_j}) \label{eqn-gsyn}
\end{align}
with $\tau_e = 2$~ms the excitatory time constant, echoing AMPA receptor dynamics \citep{Hausser1997-cn}, $\tau_i = 4$~ms the inhibitory time constant, echoing GABA-A receptor dynamics \citep{Destexhe1994-oc}, $\boldsymbol E$ and $\boldsymbol I$ the sets of presynaptic excitatory and inhibitory neurons, respectively, $w$ the synaptic weight, $\delta(\cdot)$ the Dirac delta function, and $\hat{t}$ the spike times.

Excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses were subject to short-term depression (STD), simplified from \cite{Tsodyks1997-qt}; since synaptic transmission was not stochastic, we modeled the depression variable $x_j$ as a property of the presynaptic neuron $j$,
\begin{equation}
    \tau_x \frac{dx_j}{dt} = (1-x_j) - U x_j \delta(t - \hat{t}) \label{eqn-xsyn}
\end{equation}
with recovery time constant $\tau_x = 150$~ms and release fraction $U = 0.4$.

When a neuron's membrane potential reached the firing threshold $V_\theta$, a spike was emitted, and the potential was clamped to $V_m = V_{reset} = -74$~mV for a fixed refractory period of 3~ms (excitatory neurons). Inhibitory neurons were modeled as fast-spiking cells with a refractory period of 2~ms and a constant firing threshold $V_\theta = \theta_0 = -54$~mV \citep{Mensi2012-au}. In contrast, excitatory neurons were modeled with threshold adaptation (TA) as in \cite{Teeter2018-iz}, following
\begin{align}
    V_\theta &= \theta_0 + V_{TA}(t) \nonumber \\
    \tau_{\theta} \frac{dV_{TA}}{dt} &= -V_{TA} + \hat{\theta} \delta(t - \hat{t}) \label{eqn-TA}
\end{align}
with increment $\hat{\theta} = 1$~mV and decay time constant $\tau_{\theta} = 1$~s \citep{Pozzorini2015-ei}.

\textbf{Fig. 1} Model and paradigm. \textbf{a} Membrane and synaptic dynamics of a neuron innervated by an excitatory and an inhibitory neuron firing pre-determined spikes, illustrated above the plots. The excitatory connection has weight $w = 3$ for demonstration purposes only; a single connection with $w = 1$ is normally unable to evoke postsynaptic firing. Top: Inputs to the (post-)synaptic conductances $g_e$ and $g_i$ (vertical bars), and the STD depression variable $x_{Exc}$ of the excitatory presynaptic neuron (dashed line). Note that excitatory inputs are equal to $U x_{Exc} w$ as per Equation \ref{eqn-gsyn}. Middle: Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances ($g_e$ and $g_i$, respectively). Bottom: Membrane voltage, firing threshold baseline (gray) and adaptive threshold, demonstrating TA in the excitatory postsynaptic neuron. \textbf{b} Sample network layout, showing the spatial location of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and all outgoing synaptic connections from two neurons of each type. \textbf{c} Distance from stimulation site 1 in terms of minimum number of excitatory synapses. Stimulation is provided to the 10 neurons nearest to the center of each of 5 stimulation sites (large circles), which are regularly spaced on a circle with a radius of 2.5 mm. \textbf{d} Illustration of the stimulation paradigm. Each marker represents a stimulation, with the stimulus identity indicated by color. The target stimulus (A) is represented as solid red, and non-target stimuli are represented with faded colors. Three randomized sequences were presented, containing 80\% A and 20\% B (std), 20\% A and 80\% B (dev), and 20\% of each of 5 stimuli, including A and B (msc). Note that, while the onset asynchrony of 500 ms is represented faithfully, the horizontal extent of the stimulation markers has no meaning; stimuli were presented instantaneously rather than over an extended period.

Figure \ref{fig1}a shows the internal and presynaptic dynamics of an excitatory neuron in a contrived example for the purpose of illustration. The model was implemented in Brian2 \citep{Stimberg2019-tc}, accelerated with Brian2GeNN \citep{Stimberg2020-go}, and simulated with an integration time step of 1~ms. Synaptic delay was not modeled explicitly, but spikes were delivered, and voltages reset, in the time step following spike emission. We simulated neurons without any stochasticity in either their inputs or their parameters, other than network structure (described below), in order to ensure that our results were driven purely by the experimental paradigm, rather than any model-internal sources of noise.

800 excitatory and 200 inhibitory neurons were placed randomly in a two-dimensional circular space with a radius of 4~mm, and formed synapses of weight $w = 1$ with 50 randomly selected postsynaptic partners within a range of 2~mm (excitatory) or 1~mm (inhibitory), reflecting the notion that excitatory neurons project over longer distances, while inhibitory neurons mainly connect to their local neighborhood. Connectivity and weights remained fixed throughout. Stimulation sites were evenly distributed 2.5~mm from the center of the dish, and stimulation delivered a one-time increase in $g_e$ to the 10 closest neurons, sufficient to trigger 2-3 spikes each. See Figure \ref{fig1}b and c for a representative example of the resulting network structure. Networks were pseudo-randomly generated according to the above scheme and screened for minimal stimulus response: Networks where fewer than 500 neurons responded to stimulation at any of the five sites after full recovery were discarded. In total, 30 networks were used for the experiments described below.

\subsection{Paradigm}\label{sec-paradigm}

To investigate deviance detection, we used a classical oddball paradigm as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig1}d, presenting a total of 500 stimuli at regular intervals of 500~ms. Target stimuli (labeled "A" or "target" hereafter) and distractor stimuli (labeled B to E) were presented in three randomized sequences: The "standard" sequence (std), consisting of 400 presentations of A and 100 presentations of B; the "deviant" sequence (dev) with 100 A and 400 B, and the many-standards control sequence (msc) with 100 presentations of each of the stimuli A through E. In this way, A is presented as the predominant and therefore expected stimulus (std), as an infrequent violation of an expectation (of B, dev), and, to control for pure adaptation effects, as an equally infrequent stimulus with no strong expectation of any particular input (msc).

In each network, we simulated oddball sequences with two A/B stimulus pairs (sites 1 and 2 in one pair, and sites 3 and 5 in the other pair), where each stimulus site in a pair was used once as target (A) and once as non-target (B), and a single msc sequence involving all sites. Networks were reset to a fully recovered state between sequence presentations to guarantee their independence. This yielded 4 complete data sets per network, or a total of 120 data sets across all networks.

In order to disentangle the effects of STD and TA, we ran all simulations in four conditions: Without any short-term plasticity, with either TA only or STD only, and with both STD and TA (labeled STD+TA in the following, and corresponding to the full model as described above). To turn off STD, we replaced Equation \ref{eqn-xsyn} with a constant $x = 1$, but retained the scaling of inputs to $g_e$ with $U$ in Equation \ref{eqn-gsyn}. This corresponds to immediate recovery ($\tau_x = 0$) and was done to maintain the magnitude of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in the recovered state regardless of whether STD was turned on or off. To turn off TA, we replaced Equation \ref{eqn-TA} with a constant $V_{TA} = 0$, making the firing threshold completely unadaptive.

\textbf{Fig. 2} Deviance detection in our model. \textbf{a} Sample network target response intensity by trial type. Each horizontal line of the plot summarizes the network response in one target trial in terms of spikes per integration time step. Target trials are taken from the std (400), msc (100), and dev (100) sequences, and sorted by sequence time (earliest trials are at the bottom of each section). \textbf{b} Response summary, showing average network-wide spike counts in target trials in each sequence. The underlying data are the same as in panel a. Note how the dev response is very large, followed by an intermediate msc response and a low std response. \textbf{c} Mismatch, adaptation, and deviance detection indices (see Equation \ref{eqn-ddi}) across networks and stimuli (n = 120). In this and later boxplots, the median is indicated with an orange line, notches indicate the 95\% confidence interval for the median calculated by bootstrap with 10000 iterations, boxes indicate the inter-quartile range (IQR), whiskers extend to 1.5 times the IQR or to the data extrema, whichever is less, and fliers indicate individual data points beyond the whisker end points

We define deviance detection as a network's ability to pick out unexpected inputs from an otherwise homogeneous or otherwise unsurprising stream of inputs. Following related research \citep{Kubota2021-dx,Harms2014-ah,Jacobsen2001-sc}, we were careful to exclude effects due to stimulus identity (i.e., avoiding direct comparisons between different stimuli) or due to adaptation to frequent stimulus presentation (i.e., avoiding direct comparisons of A in the dev sequence to A in the std sequence). In other words, we used the msc sequence as a neutral baseline where the target stimulus was presented no more often than in the dev sequence, but no expectation of a competing stimulus B could be formed. To quantify deviance detection, we compared the mean number of spikes $R^A$ fired across the network in response to target stimulus A in the dev and msc sequences, defining a deviance detection index (DDI) as
\begin{equation}
    DDI = \frac{R^A_{dev} - R^A_{msc}}{R^A_{dev} + R^A_{msc}} \label{eqn-ddi}
\end{equation}
We define stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA, $R^A_{msc} - R^A_{std}$) and mismatch ($R^A_{dev} - R^A_{std}$) indices analogously, capturing respectively the effect of adaptation, and of both adaptation and deviance detection together.

% Our first aim was to replicate deviance detection properties reported in dissociated neuronal cell culture by \cite{Kubota2021-dx}, reproduced in Figure \ref{fig2}a. In their case, cell cultures -- like our model, randomly connected networks with two-dimensional extent -- were stimulated at 10 different sites in msc sequences, and at two sites with 10\%/90\% probability in dev and std sequences. Deviance detection was assessed analogously to our definition of DDI and reached an average level of around 0.3 across two cultures.

% In our model, we could readily identify networks and stimuli whose responses developed in a qualitatively similar fashion, with high activity in response to target in the dev sequence, low activity in the std sequence, and intermediate activity in the msc sequence, as illustrated with an example in Figure \ref{fig2}b. The model responses developed on a compressed time scale compared to neuronal culture, which we tentatively attribute to unfaithful aspects of the model, including a lack of conduction delay or spontaneous activity, a much smaller number of participating neurons, and structural differences.

% Across networks and stimuli (Figure \ref{fig2}c), we found that our model reliably produced positive mismatch responses (T = 6.67e+03, p = 9.26e-16; one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 120) while both SSA index (T = 6.19e+03, p = 9.76e-12) and DDI (T = 5.97e+03, p = 4.75e-10) were also positive. The average DDI value reached around 0.1, which was less than the values reported by \cite{Kubota2021-dx}, but note that our target stimuli were presented more frequently (20\%) than theirs (10\%) in the dev and msc sequences.

Boxes summarize the spike count totals per trial (right axis), the means of which form the basis for index calculations (see panel c). Note the different axis scaling on the top row (without TA) and the bottom row (with TA). \textbf{b} Adaptation indices $<$msc - std$>$ across all networks and stimuli. Asterisks indicate data greater than 0, established with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test at a significance level 0.05. See main text for detailed statistics. \textbf{c} Deviance detection indices $<$dev - msc$>$ across all networks and stimuli

Having confirmed the presence of deviance detection in our model, we then turned to an ablation approach to try to identify how the two short-term plasticity mechanisms in the model, STD and TA, enabled the networks to learn relevant regularities. In the remainder of the paper, we will proceed to detail the processes leading to deviance detection on a sample network, then confirm the highlighted trends statistically with reference to the full set of 120 networks and stimuli. The sample network was chosen to be roughly representative of the population as follows: We assessed each network's average response to stimulation with A and B in the msc sequence and calculated z-scores with respect to the population. We then focused on networks whose absolute z-score was less than 1 for both A and B responses, and hand-picked a sample that exhibited both an increased DDI in STD+TA over TA only, and positive SSA indices in both STD+TA and TA only conditions.

Figure \ref{fig3}a shows the responses to target stimulation of the sample network under ablation. With no plasticity, the responses are indistinguishable between sequences, yielding a DDI of 0, and indicating that stimulation did not have any long-lasting effects in membrane voltage or synaptic conductance. With STD only, the response in the dev sequence developed earlier and very slightly larger, yielding a DDI of 0.03. With TA only, the response became noticeably smaller, but the sequences became readily distinguishable, with high dev, intermediate msc, and low std responses, yielding a DDI of 0.19. Finally, in the full model, the dev response stood out more clearly, leaving much smaller msc and std responses and yielding a DDI of 0.4.

The SSA index (Figure \ref{fig3}b) was exactly 0 as expected in the ablation with no plasticity, and positive with any plasticity applied (STD only: T = 4.97e+03, p = 0.000222, median 0.0039; TA only: T = 5.99e+03, p = 3.3e-10, median 0.097; STD+TA: T = 6.19e+03, p = 9.76e-12, median 0.135; one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, n = 120). Since the SSA index measures the degree of adaptation to frequent stimulus presentation, this indicates that both plasticity mechanisms were capable of imbuing the networks with some level of history dependence.

Finally, across networks and stimuli, the DDI (Figure \ref{fig3}c) was exactly 0 with no plasticity, not significantly different from 0 with STD only (T = 3.2e+03, p = 0.262, median -2.1e-04; two-sided Wilcoxon, n = 120), but clearly positive for TA only (T = 5.85e+03, p = 3.1e-09, median 0.077; one-sided Wilcoxon, n = 120) and the full model (T = 5.97e+03, p = 4.75e-10, median 0.114). To our surprise, the DDI of the full model was significantly greater than that of either plasticity mechanism alone (STD: T = 6.1e+03, p = 4.95e-11; TA: T = 4.87e+03, p = 0.000604), and greater too than the sum of the DDI values across both STD only and TA only models (T = 5.12e+03, p = 4.52e-05). This suggests that TA and STD act not as independent mechanisms in this paradigm, but rather interact constructively to enhance the network's ability to encode input regularities.

In the following, we will use a sample network and target stimulus to first build an understanding of how TA leads to deviance detection when acting alone, i.e. in the ablated TA only model. Then, we will build on this understanding to elucidate how the addition of STD, which was shown above to be ineffective for deviance detection on its own, can lead to an increased deviant response in the full model.

\subsection{The role of TA in deviance detection}\label{sec-ta}

To understand why the same stimulus A evoked a higher response in dev than in msc with TA only, we first compared the average responses in the two conditions, sorting neurons by their response onset to permit a high-resolution view of the population activity. As shown in Figure \ref{fig4}a (left and middle), we found that the response developed in a qualitatively similar fashion in both conditions. The contrast (right) revealed a tendency of dev spikes to occur earlier, particularly shortly after stimulation, as shown by the succession of orange (higher dev activity) by blue (higher msc activity) in the lower parts of the panel. In later parts of the response (top half of the panel), the dev response was larger, but not obviously shifted in time. Since the stimulus was identical in both conditions, and TA was the only plsaticity mechanism in play, these differences had to be due to (1) different firing thresholds, and/or (2) different synaptic currents as a consequence of different prior activity within the trial.

We quantified the former with the strength of adaptation $V_{TA}$ (Equation \ref{eqn-TA}), i.e., the amount by which the firing threshold was raised due to TA. As shown in Figure \ref{fig4}b, there was a clear and widespread lowering of thresholds at the start of target dev trials relative to msc, visible both in the raw data (left and middle panels) and in the contrast (right panel, early blue portions). In contrast, once the bulk of activity had occurred, many neurons showed higher thresholds in dev (right panel, later orange portions), since they spiked more often. Finally, note that inhibitory neurons, which were modeled without TA, naturally showed no difference in $V_{TA}$.

To assess the difference in synaptic currents in a way that allowed direct comparison to $V_{TA}$, we referred to the membrane voltage $V_m$, which is largely independent from and complementary to the firing threshold, and driven mostly by presynaptic inputs (resets after spikes notwithstanding). As the direct cause of neuronal spiking, the overall pattern of $V_m$ (Figure \ref{fig4}c) largely reflected that seen in spiking activity. The contrast (right panel) shows not only a notable relative increase in membrane voltages in dev around the typical response time (note the orange band running along the response front), but also an increased hyperpolarization starting immediately after due to post-spike resets.

\textbf{Fig. 4} Responses to dev target trials are larger due to lower $V_{TA}$.
\textbf{a} Target trial average post-stimulus spike histogram in the sample network, showing trial time along the horizontal axis, and neurons along the vertical, sorted by the time of the first recorded spike across all trials and conditions. Left and middle column, target trials in dev sequence and msc sequence, respectively; right column, contrast between these two.
\textbf{b} Target trial average of the threshold adaptation voltage $V_{TA}$, with neuron order and columns as in panel a.
\textbf{c} Target trial average of the membrane potential $V_m$, with neuron order and columns as in panel a. The first 10 ms of the neurons under direct stimulation are masked out to avoid saturation of the colormap.
\textbf{d} Relationship across excitatory neurons of the sample network between the contrast (dev - msc) in $V_{TA}$ at the start of target trials and the contrast in average number of spikes fired in target trials, and associated linear regression.
\textbf{e} Network-wide median contrast (dev - msc) in $V_{TA}$ across networks and stimuli, plotted against the Pearson correlation coefficients $\rho$ of the relationship shown in the previous panel ($\Delta V_{TA}$ vs response size contrast across excitatory neurons). Each marker corresponds to one network and target stimulus. Red markers indicate a significant correlation (two-sided t-test, significance level 0.05). Inset histograms show the distribution of the corresponding values, with orange portions indicating the 95\% confidence interval of the median, calculated by bootstrap with 10000 iterations.
\textbf{f} In the sample network, contribution of the contrast in $V_{TA}$ and $V_m$ to bins with increased firing in dev (i.e., positive/red bins in the spike probability contrast, panel a), weighted by that same contrast.
\textbf{g} Contribution of $V_{TA}$ relative to the sum of the absolute values of the weighted contributions in panel f.
\textbf{h} Relative contribution of $V_{TA}$ across networks and stimuli, showing median (solid line) and inter-quartile range (shaded area)

Based on these measures, we then asked why there were more spikes in dev trials. We first focused on the contribution of $V_{TA}$ alone in an effort to confirm that thresholds are lower in dev, and that this reduction in thresholds causes increased firing. We correlated the level of $V_{TA}$ at the start of target trials (i.e., at the left edge of the histograms in Figure \ref{fig4}b) with the average target trial response of each excitatory neuron in terms of spikes fired. In the sample network (Figure \ref{fig4}d), we found that thresholds were clearly lower in dev than msc (T = 2.69e+04, p = 1.58e-92, median = -0.166 mV; one-sided Wilcoxon, n = 800), and this decrease was accompanied by an increase in the target trial response at the level of individual neurons (Pearson's $\rho$ = -0.424, p = 1.6e-36; one-sided Wald test, n = 800). As shown in Figure \ref{fig4}e, this relationship held across networks and stimuli: Average $V_{TA}$ was lower in dev than msc (T = 1.24e+03, p = 2.07e-10, median = -0.074 mV; one-sided Wilcoxon, n = 120), and the neuron-level correlation between the contrasts in $V_{TA}$ and target response was almost universally negative (T = 40, p = 2.68e-21, median = -0.357). This indicates that networks were less adapted during oddball sequences, and that this lack of adaptation played an important role in the increased response to deviant inputs.

Yet, as we saw in Figure \ref{fig4}c, the membrane voltages also differed between the two conditions. In order to assess the relative contribution of $V_{TA}$ to the increased dev response, we chose to focus exclusively on time points with higher firing probability in the dev sequence, discarding data points with equal or lower firing probability relative to the msc sequence. We then weighted the remaining contrasts in $V_{TA}$ and $V_m$ by the magnitude of the response difference, and summed across neurons. The resulting time courses, shown in Figure \ref{fig4}f, show how much these two measures contributed to the increased dev response. While thresholds were slighly lowered throughout the response, the membrane potential was dramatically increased. In relative terms (Figure \ref{fig4}g), $V_{TA}$ constituted a major driver of increased firing right at the onset of the response, as well as briefly towards the end of the response. A similar pattern emerged across networks and stimuli, as shown in Figure \ref{fig4}h. Here, only the initial response was driven mainly by $V_{TA}$, while later differences were largely explained by differences in $V_m$, leading to a relative TA contribution of less than 20\% on average. This indicates that adaptation initiated and dominated the increase in firing in the beginning, whereas the late response was enlarged primarily as a result of increased presynaptic excitation.

Having established that the increased response to A in dev trials was driven by lower thresholds, we next turned to the cause of this reduction. A priori, since threshold adaptation is a direct reflection of activity, and since the response to target trials was larger in dev than in msc, the lower thresholds in dev must have been caused by lower activity in non-target trials, i.e. lower responses to B in dev than to B through E in msc. Yet, with activity modulated by thresholds as shown above, we might expect to observe higher dev responses regardless of stimulus. To resolve this apparent paradox, we will turn to an analysis of the spatial arrangement of activity and adaptation.

First, we mapped the average value of $V_{TA}$ at the start of target trials to the spatial location of the neurons, as shown in Figure \ref{fig5}a. In the msc sequence, $V_{TA}$ was roughly evenly distributed across the network, consistent with the random, distributed nature of stimulation. Conversely, in the dev sequence, neurons near the non-target stimulation site (B) were strongly adapted, whereas the majority of the network was less adapted, consistent with the data shown above.
Next, we turned to the likely cause of this difference, the non-target responses (Figure \ref{fig5}b), mapped into space as the average number of spikes fired in each neuron. As expected, the pattern of activity in non-target trials, constituting 80\% of all trials, closely matched that of the thresholds. Notably, although the comparison is between 400 B trials in dev, and only 100 B trials (alongside 300 C, D and E trials) in msc, only a small handful of neurons responded more to non-target stimulation in dev, most of these very close to the stimulation site of B.

Correlating the non-target response and thresholds excitatory neurons (Figure \ref{fig5}c), we found that the reduced non-target response magnitude in dev (t = -7.61, p = 3.5e-12, median = -0.044; one-sided t-test, n = 800) almost perfectly predicted the resulting reduction in threshold adaptation levels (Pearson's $\rho$ = 0.99).
This finding held across networks and stimuli, as shown in Figure \ref{fig5}d, with a median correlation coefficient of 0.994 and a consistent reduction in the average non-target response between msc and dev sequences (t = -11.6, p = 1.46e-21, median = -0.058; one-sided t-test, n = 120), clearly validating our notion that the non-target trial response is the primary driver of threshold adaptation.

\textbf{c} Median contrast (dev - msc) in $V_{TA}$ among the early and late neurons, respectively, across networks and stimuli

Finally, we examined the cause of the reduced response in non-target trials. Going from the msc sequence to the dev sequence, two things change: Firstly, stimulations with non-target C, D and E are replaced with B, which would cause different responses even in the absence of adaptation. Secondly, the resulting  frequent presentation of B changes TA values, likely causing adaptation to B and therefore decreasing the average response. We hypothesized that this adaptation is mediated by a small subset of neurons that (a) responds very quickly to stimulation in B, (b) responds more strongly to non-target stimuli in dev than msc, and (c) has increased TA levels as a result, reducing the later response in the same way as demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig4} in reverse.

To see this in the sample network, consider first the latency of responses to B across all conditions, shown by way of rank order in Figure \ref{fig6}a. We found that the response developed in an approximately radial pattern, spreading outward from the stimulus site. We did notice that the early response appears to gravitate towards the stimulus site for A, but confirmed that this was the case in all conditions separately, indicating a structural rather than dynamic cause (data not shown). We then notionally split the network into an early portion, containing the first 100 neurons to respond to B in any condition, and a late portion, containing the remaining 900 neurons. In Figure \ref{fig6}b, we related the response contrast (dev - msc) to the contrast in $V_{TA}$ at the start of B trials. Across all neurons, a strong linear relationship (Pearson's $\rho$ = 0.98) echoed the related finding in Figure \ref{fig5}c. As the color coding and inset histograms show, however, there was a clear separation between the early and late portions of the network, with many early neurons (red) increasing their response in the dev sequence, while the network as a whole decreased. Correspondingly, the TA levels of this portion of the network also tended to increase, in clear contrast to the network as a whole.

Across networks and stimuli, we found even stronger evidence that the early portion of the network drove adaptation to B. We first confirmed that the non-target response and $V_{TA}$ contrasts were robustly correlated (Median Pearson's $\rho$ 0.996, T = 7.26e+03, p = 9.86e-22; one-sided Wilcoxon test for $\rho > 0$, n = 120). In each network, we then identified the early and late portions with respect to stimulation in B and quantified the median non-target response contrast (Figure \ref{fig6}c) and the median contrast in $V_{TA}$ at the start of B trials (Figure \ref{fig6}d) within these two portions. We found that the response in the early portion was consistently greater in dev than msc (T = 6.98e+03, p = 8.48e-19; one-sided Wilcoxon, n = 120), unlike the late portion, which decreased (T = 295, p = 1.23e-18; see also Figure \ref{fig5}d). The contrast in $V_{TA}$ followed the same pattern, with the early portion exhibiting stronger TA in dev (T = 4.63e+03, p = 2.21e-17), while the late portion was more recovered (T = 26, p = 2.97e-17).

To sum up, we showed in Figure \ref{fig4} that greater $V_{TA}$ in the portion of the network responding earliest to a stimulus plays an important role in reducing the overall response. Here, we showed that the neurons responding earliest to B exhibit higher $V_{TA}$ in the dev sequence as a consequence of an increased response, in direct contrast to the response and TA levels of the network as a whole.

Thus, we have finally traced the greater response to A in the dev sequence to its roots, and revealed two complementary roles of TA: The frequent presentation of non-target stimulus B in the dev sequence and concomitant increased activity in a subset of neurons responding early to B causes \emph{local adaptation} by TA in this subset, leading to smaller network responses. By contrast, stimuli in the msc sequence are presented more sporadically, allowing local adaptation to decay, thus leading to larger network responses. This difference in non-target response sizes -- small in dev, large in msc -- is then reflected in network-wide \emph{global adaptation}, such that the network is more excitable to stimulation with A (or other non-standard inputs) in the dev sequence.

\subsection{The role of STD in deviance detection}\label{sec-std}

As noted previously, short-term depression alone exerted no deviance detection effect, but its addition did enhance the deviance detection effect established by TA. To understand the basis of this apparent synergy, we contrasted the TA only condition examined in the previous section against the same networks with both TA and STD. On average, adding STD caused a reduction in response magnitude across the board, as we would expect from a depression mechanism (data not shown). However, this reduction was not uniform: Target responses were reduced most in the std sequence, and least in the dev sequence.

To understand the reason for this asymmetry, we first focused on the target response and asked how and why the target response contrast (dev - msc) changed as STD was added to the model. As shown in Figure \ref{fig7}a, the target response was greater in dev than msc in both the full and the ablated model (indicating a positive DDI in both models, cf. also Figure \ref{fig3}). In most neurons, the contrast was greater in the full model, such that the difference (full - ablated) was positive, as indicated by the largely orange plot in the right column.
Following the logic established in the previous section, we may expect a greater target response in dev to be caused by lower $V_{TA}$ relative to msc. Indeed, comparing the contrast (dev - msc) in $V_{TA}$ before target trials across models (Figure \ref{fig7}b), we see that, while the contrast is negative (i.e., lower in dev) in both models, the magnitude of the contrast is greater in the full model. For clarity, the difference is therefore negative, as indicated by the largely blue plot in the right column.
Lastly, we trace this one step further back in Figure \ref{fig7}c: Again as established in the previous section, a greater contrast in $V_{TA}$ may be explained by a similarly enhanced contrast (dev - msc) in the non-target response. We found exactly this: The non-target response was smaller in dev than msc by a greater margin in the full model, as indicated by the largely blue plot in the right column.

This pattern was reflected also in the aggregate across networks and stimuli. Firstly, the contrast (dev - msc) in the target response (Figure \ref{fig7}d, left) was positive in both models, but the full model contrast was greater than the ablated model contrast (t = 2.99, p = 0.00168; one-sided t-test, n = 120). Referring to the previous section, we identify the cause for this in an enhanced contrast in $V_{TA}$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig7}e; the contrast (dev - msc) in the full model was more negative than that in the ablated model (t = -3.49, p = 0.000342). Lastly, returning to Figure \ref{fig7}d (right), we see that the driver of $V_{TA}$, namely the non-target response size, also showed an enhanced contrast (dev - msc) in the full model relative to the ablation (t = -3.19, p = 0.000921). To sum up, the reason for the larger target dev response relative to msc, was the smaller non-target dev response relative to msc; furthermore, since the relationships established in the previous section remained largely unchanged, this effect appeared to be mediated primarily through TA.

This naturally raises the question of why, with the addition of STD, the non-target dev response was reduced more than other responses. We hypothesized that, due to its relatively short time constant, the direct effect of STD across trials was limited to repeated trials of the same stimulus, such as the frequent stimulus in oddball sequences.

We had good reasons for this assumption: Firstly, notice that the ablated model with STD only produced only a positive SSA index (i.e., the target response in msc was greater than in std), but not a significantly positive DDI (i.e., no difference between target dev and msc responses). Secondly, we note that updates to the spike-triggered depression variable $x_j$ (cf. Equation \ref{eqn-xsyn}) would decay to a negligible $e^\frac{-1 s}{\tau_x} = 0.0013$ times the original value within two trials, making it unlikely that inputs separated by intervening trials could be "remembered" in the network. Conversely, the frequently presented stimulus B could lead to a build-up of depression strong enough to suppress its own response. Referring back to Figure \ref{fig3}b, we see that there was indeed a significant, if small, effect of presentation frequency even in the ablated model with STD only, yielding a positive SSA index on average.
% To show this in the sample network, we correlated the number of spikes in dev target trials with the spike-triggered depression variable $x_j$ at the start of later trials (cf. Equation \ref{eqn-xsyn}) across excitatory neurons. We found that, while the correlation was very clear in the trial immediately following target (Pearson's $\rho$ = -0.984, p = 0; n = 800), it was almost completely lost by the next trial ($\rho$ = -0.0525, p = 0.138) under the influence of both decay and unrelated activity in the intervening trial.

To show that STD being carried over between trials was responsible for the reduction of non-target dev pulses relative to msc, we needed to estimate the extent to which activity of a given neuron (or, alternatively, its membrane potential $V_m$) was affected by changes in STD. Unlike $V_{TA}$, which directly affected the neuron to which the value belongs, $x_j$ exerted its effects on the other side of a synapse. Therefore, we devised a measure $D$ to estimate the postsynaptic impact of STD in terms of membrane potential lost, mirroring the effect of $V_{TA}$ in the sense that decreasing $V_m$ and increasing the firing threshold both increase the depolarization necessary to bring a neuron to fire.
A measure of STD is necessarily activity-dependent -- a postsynaptic neuron's membrane potential is driven only by presynaptic partners that fire -- so it must be calculated based on observed activity. Here, we used the average trial response $R_j^S$ of neuron $j$ to a given stimulus $S$, in number of spikes, as the presynaptic drive. Before depression, a single excitatory presynaptic spike evokes a postsynaptic potential (EPSP) peaking at approximately $k = 1.4$ mV at rest (recall that $w = 1$ for all synapses), and STD linearly scales this EPSP by presynaptic $x_j$. Thus, we estimated the average peak EPSP evoked by a spike in presynaptic neuron $j$ as $R_j^S k x_j^S$. For this estimate, we ignored added depression due to repeated spikes within a trial, instead defining $x_j^S$ as the average depression at the start of trials. Finally, summing over presynaptic neurons, we estimated the peak EPSP lost to depression in a given neuron $i$ as
\begin{equation}
    D_i^S = \sum_{j \in pre} R_j^S k (1-x_j^S)
\end{equation}
Notice that $D$ is measured in volts due to scaling with $k$, and is therefore roughly comparable to $V_{TA}$, albeit more approximate. Lastly, since we contrasted this measure between conditions (see below), we aimed to avoid effects purely due to differences in presynaptic activity. Therefore, we calculated $R^S$ as the average response across relevant trials in all conditions, leaving the contrast entirely in the hands of $x^S$.

Inset histograms show the distribution of the corresponding values, with orange portions indicating the 95\% confidence interval of the median, calculated by bootstrap with 10000 iterations.

As noted above, we hypothesized that, in the full model, STD is directly responsible only for a reduction of non-target dev trials, relative to msc, whereas differences between target dev and msc trials are not a result of STD directly. To show this, we calculated $D$ for A and B trials, and contrasted it across dev and msc conditions as with $V_{TA}$ before.
In Figure \ref{fig8}a, we see that target trials (top) experienced depression across large parts of the sample network in both conditions. The msc sequence, however, clearly evoked greater depression, as borne out in the contrast (dev - msc), which was negative throughout. Conversely, depression in B trials (bottom) was spatially more clustered around the stimulation site in both conditions. In the msc sequence, we can attribute the difference between A and B primarily to the response size: The context was the same, but responses to B tended not to spread out as much in this network. However, in the dev sequence, the B response was limited almost exclusively to a very local patch around the stimulation site (see also Figure \ref{fig6}a), with depression therefore similarly limited. As a result, the contrast (dev - msc) showed slightly reduced $D$ in the periphery, but strikingly elevated $D$ near the stimulation site, indicating greatly increased synaptic depression in dev.

To show how robust these effects were, we turn to statistics across networks and stimuli. We calculated the trial-average depression values $D^A$ and $D^B$ in dev and msc conditions, subtracted them, then calculated the mean over neurons. The resulting contrasts are summarized in Figure \ref{fig8}b. We note first that neurons were subject to more depression in B trials than in A trials in the dev sequence (-4.47, p = 9.02e-06; one-sided t-test, n = 120, data not shown), but not in the msc sequence (by definition). Furthermore, $D^B$ was greater in dev than msc (8.02, p = 4.05e-13). Both findings confirm that STD carried over between the frequent standard trials, but not, or less so, between the less frequent control and deviant trials.
However, we also found that $D^A$ was greater in msc than dev (-7.54, p = 5.04e-12; one-sided t-test, n = 120), suggesting that STD did exert stimulus-independent suppression in the msc sequence, as is clearly seen in the sample network, and similar to what we described earlier for TA.

Finally, to show that $D$ reflects suppression of a neuron's activity, we quantified the relationship between the contrasts in $D$ and the corresponding response size contrast. In the sample network (Figure \ref{fig8}c), we see that neurons with a greater decrease in $D$ from msc to dev had correspondingly greater response increase, and vice versa. Across both A and B trials, this relationship was captured well by a linear regression (A: Pearson's $\rho$ = -0.541, p = 2.28e-77, B: $\rho$ = -0.186, p = 1.61e-09; one-sided t-test, n = 1000). These findings were borne out across most networks and stimuli (Figure \ref{fig8}d), showing that $D$ captures the impact of STD not only on $V_m$, but also on the resulting output spikes.

To sum up, in the full model, STD acted in much the same way as TA, causing both a reduction of the response to the frequently presented standard stimuli (dev B) by adaptation, and an increase in the response to deviant stimuli (dev A) by relief from adaptation, relative to control. Yet, as we showed in Figure \ref{fig7} and in the previous section, a decrease in dev B responses also entailed lower $V_{TA}$, and higher dev A response by consequence. Thus, adding STD to the model increased the DDI both directly, as outlined at the start of this paragraph, and indirectly, by altering the pattern of TA by way of changed responses.
